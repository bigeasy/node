Requirements to build.

 * git with some flavor of ssh.
 * Visual Studio C++ 2008 Express Edition
 * The pthreads headers and ddl.

Let's assume you've already pulled the source code from GitHub onto Windows.

 * Place the headers in a folder named pthreads next to the node checkout.
 * Open the project at node/deps/libeio/windows/vstudio/libeio.vcproj.
 * Press F7.

The required directory structure can be seen below.
